Java-Pythagorean-Theorem-Algorithm--Brute-Force-Example
=======================================================

Code written in Java that searches for any combination of numbers between 1-500 that get the same results of the Pythagorean theorem equation: a^2 + b^2 = c^2

Requirements of the were as stated in the book: Java How to Program: Exercise 4.21 page 165

"A right triangle can have sides whose lengths are all integers.
The set of three integer values for the lengths of the sides of a right triangle
is called a Pythagorean Triple. The lengths of three sides must satisfy the relationship that the sum of the
squares of two of the sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse.Write an application that displays a table of Pythagorean triples for side1,
side2, and hypotenuse,all no longer than 500. Use a triple-nested for loop that tries all possibilities. This method is an example of “brute force” computing. You’ll learn in more advanced computer science courses that for many interesting
problems there is no known algorithmic approach other than sheer brute force.
Algebra equation for a Pythagorean Triple is:(a*a) + (b*b) = (c*c)"
